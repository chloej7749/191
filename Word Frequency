# Explanations
Question 2: I would loop through the words on the website and follow the same method. I would make sure to omit printing out words we've already seen as then it would just be useless to print them out. I would see if Java has something similar to Python's dictionaries, which would be a lot more efficient.
Question 3: It took a while to grasp the concept because at first I didn't see the point in having a listSize while still having wordsList = 20. But I realized that I needed this listSize variable in my loop through the user's input.
There were other issues here and there as well. I had to find  .equalsIgnoreCase(), which helped a lot. I didn't know that .equalsIgnoreCase() could be used before, so it was definitely cool to learn something new.
